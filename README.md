# A-Review-of-Text-Style-Transfer
This repo will give an deep analysis of the most recent reseaches on text style transfer. Compared with [others](https://github.com/fuzhenxin/Style-Transfer-in-Text), the **highlights** are:
- **Classify and interpret current papers.**
- **Focus on the reproducibility of experiments, especially on test datasets, human references and related metrics.**

I will update this repo as soon as possible.
